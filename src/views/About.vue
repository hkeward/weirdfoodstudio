      <strong>Jessi Wood</strong> illustrates, prints, paints, draws, and
      generally toys with wistful forces within the Weird Food Studio that
      cannot be understood
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>And tits.</p>
    <p>Lots of tits, I tell yah</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      A lady who summons powers of the weird, the grimy, the melancholic, and
      the deep, electric pull you feel towards a juicy fruit you can’t have,
      before noticing it’s growing a vulva
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Harnessing those vibes, she crafts visual bubblegum for surrounding
      eyeballs to chew
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Similar, strange folk are welcome to join her in collaboration or
      commission
    </p>

      Find more of her weird food on Instagram, find her prints on Etsy, and
      find her below the cherry moon in an ancient dusk
